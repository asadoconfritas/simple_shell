### Description
This is a project made for Holberton School. It consists in a custom simple Unix shell made from scratch.  
  
The shell is the interface to the operating system. It is a command interpreter; which means that it takes an input passes it to the operating system. 
Then, it displays the results of the operation on the screen.  
  
This version of the Unix shell is quite simple, but it is very efficient in preventing any memory leak.
